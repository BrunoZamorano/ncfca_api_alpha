# Refactoring Plan: Group Club Use Cases

This plan outlines the steps to refactor the use cases from `club.controller.ts` and `club-management.controller.ts`, grouping them into a single `club` folder as requested.

## 1. Create New Target Directory

A single directory will be created to house the refactored use cases:

*   `src/application/use-cases/club/`

## 2. Move All Related Use Cases

The following use cases, identified from the specified controllers, will be moved to the new `src/application/use-cases/club/` directory. This includes moving the entire folder for each use case to maintain the file structure.

*   **From `club.controller.ts`:**
    *   Move `src/application/use-cases/search-clubs` to `src/application/use-cases/club/search-clubs`
    *   Move `src/application/use-cases/get-club-info` to `src/application/use-cases/club/get-club-info`
*   **From `club-management.controller.ts`:**
    *   Move `src/application/use-cases/list-pending-enrollments` to `src/application/use-cases/club/list-pending-enrollments`
    *   Move `src/application/use-cases/list-members-of-my-club` to `src/application/use-cases/club/list-members-of-my-club`
    *   Move `src/application/use-cases/list-all-enrollments` to `src/application/use-cases/club/list-all-enrollments`
    *   Move `src/application/use-cases/approve-enrollment` to `src/application/use-cases/club/approve-enrollment`
    *   Move `src/application/use-cases/reject-enrollment` to `src/application/use-cases/club/reject-enrollment`
    *   Move `src/application/use-cases/remove-club-member` to `src/application/use-cases/club/remove-club-member`
    *   Move `src/application/use-cases/update-club-info` to `src/application/use-cases/club/update-club-info`
    *   Move `src/application/use-cases/get-my-club-info` to `src/application/use-cases/club/get-my-club-info`

## 3. Build and Fix Imports

After moving the files, run `pnpm build`. The TypeScript compiler will report all broken import paths. I will fix all reported import errors in the affected files, which will likely include:
*   `src/infraestructure/controllers/club/club.controller.ts`
*   `src/infraestructure/controllers/club-management/club-management.controller.ts`
*   Any NestJS Module files where these use cases are registered as providers.
*   All corresponding test files (`.spec.ts`).

## 4. Cleanup

*   Delete the old, now-empty use case directories from `src/application/use-cases/`.
